    "We work for a large supermarket chain, with stores in 10 major cities that happen to coincide with General Assembly campuses. However, this company's idea of a \"database\" is just a bunch of Excel spreadsheets! In order to analyze our data, we're going to need to process the existing data into a form we can use. **Our end goal is to have one csv per city.**\n",

Keep your code so that if you get February data, you only need to change one tiny piece of the script (probably a file path)."
